This is a neural network that takes 1000 16 by 16 matrix (complex128) representations of quantum systems, generates tomographies, amd from said tomography data outputs negativity and non-Markovian noise. My task was to aid my supervisor in her research regarding detection of quantum non-Markovian (correlated) noise.
